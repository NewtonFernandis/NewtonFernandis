# üí´ About Me:
Hi there, I'm Newton Fernandis, <br>a front-end engineer at [Biofourmis](https://www.biofourmis.com/). I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives.<br><br>Recently, I've been exploring the backend world and learning about scalable system design. <br>I'm constantly in awe of how much there is to learn and grateful for the opportunities to expand my knowledge.<br>I'm also an open source fanatic, always on the hunt for my next coding fix. You can find me collaborating on projects and soaking up knowledge from the brightest minds on GitHub.<br><br>
When I'm not coding or reading up on tech, I'm probably watching anime and living vicariously through my favorite characters. Can we talk about how epic One piece is?<br><br>
So yeah, that's me in a nutshell. Let's connect and geek out over all things tech!
